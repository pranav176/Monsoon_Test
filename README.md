I have uploaded the file in which code has been run but for running the code, you have to upload the dataset file which is senior_ds_test which has split data into train and test. 

Since, the data is imbalanced, i have used SMOTE to balance the dataset but it has increased the memory to a larger extent, so experimented on a normal given dataset
